# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Project Title: Python Fun

This project is the work of `Zerihun`, a student, with guidance and mentorship from **Guillaume**.

## Script Details

### Script File
- File Name: `bracket_finder.py`
- Shebang: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Python Version: 3.8.5

### Code Description

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

for i in range(1, 10):
    if i <= 5:
        print("AAAAАННННН")
    elif i >= 6 and i <= 8:
        print("WHERE ARE ALL THE BRACKETS???")
    else:
        print("HOW DO YOU PEOPLE READ THIS SYNTAX EASILY")
```

The script, authored by `ALX SE`, explores if/else statements, loops, and functions in Python. The comments within the code express humorous frustrations with Python syntax.

### Here is the breakdown of the script messages
The above code is a Python program to find all the brackets in a range. It works by iterating over the range from 1 to 10, and printing a different message depending on whether the current number is less than or equal to 5, between 6 and 8, or greater than 8.

The first message, AAAAАННННН, is a string of Russian characters that translate to "AAAAH!!!!". The second message, WHERE ARE ALL THE BRACKETS???, is a question that is likely being asked by the programmer, who is frustrated by the lack of brackets in the code. The third message, HOW DO YOU PEOPLE READ THIS SYNTAX EASILY, is a question that is likely being asked to the reader of the code, who is hopefully able to understand the syntax even though it is difficult to read.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreter: Python 3.8.5
- Pycodestyle Version: 2.8.*
- File Execution: All files must be executable
- Line Endings: All files should end with a new line

### README.md
- A mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder

## Usage

To execute the script, use the following command:

```bash
$ ./bracket_finder.py
```

## Style and Testing

- Pycodestyle: Version 2.8.* should be used for code styling.
- Script Length: The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

## C Scripts (Additional Information)

If you are working on C scripts, the project also includes requirements for C scripts, such as using GCC for compilation, Betty style, function limits, header file inclusion, and include guards.

Make sure to follow the specified guidelines for C scripts as outlined in your project instructions.
