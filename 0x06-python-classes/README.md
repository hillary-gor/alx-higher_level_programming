# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

## Background Context

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept in Python that introduces a new way of thinking about and organizing code. Whether you are new to OOP or already familiar with it, this project aims to solidify your understanding through practical examples and experimentation.

Make sure to read and understand all the provided materials. Avoid copying and pasting code; instead, type it out, test it, and play around with OOP concepts. The primary goal is to gain hands-on experience and develop a deep understanding of how classes and objects work.

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- Files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Include a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder
- Code should follow PEP 8 style guidelines (use pycodestyle version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- File length will be tested using `wc`
- All modules, classes, and functions should have documentation
- Documentation should provide meaningful explanations and adhere to length requirements

### Before Starting the Project

Ensure you have a solid understanding of the following topics:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is OOP
- "First-class everything"
- What is a class
- What is an object and an instance
- Difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is an attribute
- Usage of public, protected, and private attributes
- The role of `self`
- What is a method
- Special `__init__` method and its usage
- Concepts of Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- Definition and usage of a property
- Distinction between an attribute and a property in Python
- Pythonic way of writing getters and setters
- Dynamically creating new attributes for existing instances
- Binding attributes to objects and classes
- Understanding the `__dict__` of a class and/or instance
- How Python finds attributes of an object or class
- Application of the `getattr` function

## Experimentation and Learning

The most crucial takeaway from this project is to experiment with OOP. Actively play with the concepts, run examples, and deepen your understanding. The more hands-on experience you gain, the better your grasp of Python's OOP features.
