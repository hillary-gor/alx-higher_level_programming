# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

## Description
This project explores the concept that "everything is an object" in Python, delving into how Python handles various types of objects. The objective is to deepen the understanding of object behavior and how variables interact in Python.

## Background Context
The project pauses to closely examine Python's interaction with different types of objects. It highlights scenarios where variables may be unintentionally or implicitly modified. For example:

```python
>>> a = 1
>>> b = a
>>> a = 2
>>> b
1
```

Another example involves lists:

```python
>>> l = [1, 2, 3]
>>> m = l
>>> l[0] = 'x'
>>> m
['x', 2, 3]
```
