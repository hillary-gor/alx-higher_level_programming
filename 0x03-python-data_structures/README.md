# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This repository contains Python scripts that focus on the implementation of data structures such as lists and tuples. The scripts are developed and tested in accordance with specific requirements and guidelines.

## Requirements

- **Python Scripts:**
  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5)
  - All files should end with a new line
  - The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for code style
  - All files must be executable
  - File length will be tested using `wc`

- **C (if applicable):**
  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5)
  - All files should end with a new line
  - Code should follow the Betty style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
  - No global variables allowed
  - No more than 5 functions per file
  - Prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file called `lists.h`
  - Don't forget to push your header file
  - All header files should be include guarded
**Necessary Files**
- `lists.h`:
  - Header file containing prototypes for functions in corresponding Python scripts.

## Usage

To execute the Python scripts, run the following command:

```bash
./filename.py
```

## Style Checking

For style checking, use the following command:

```bash
pycodestyle filename.py
```
