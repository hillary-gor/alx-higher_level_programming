# 0x0C. Python - Almost a Circle

## Description
This project focuses on developing a Python module that represents a geometric shape similar to a circle. The module includes various functionalities such as handling the serialization and deserialization of instances, implementing a class method, static method, getter, setter, and more. The project adheres to specific coding standards, documentation practices, and unit testing.

## Requirements
- **Python Scripts:** All scripts will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5).
- **Editors:** Allowed editors include vi, vim, and emacs.
- **Shebang:** All script files should start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **README.md:** A mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder.
- **Code Style:** Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for maintaining code style.
- **Executable Files:** All files must be executable.
- **File Length:** The length of files will be tested using `wc`.
- **Documentation:** All modules, classes, and functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented.
- **Documentation Format:** A documentation is not a simple word but a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method.
- **Unit Tests:** Unit tests should be placed inside a `tests` folder. Unittest module should be used, and files/folders should start with `test_`.
- **Test Execution:** Use the command `python3 -m unittest discover tests` to execute all tests.
- **Collaboration:** Collaboration on test cases is strongly encouraged to cover all edge cases.
